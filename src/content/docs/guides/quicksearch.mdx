title: Quicksearch
---

Quicksearch allows you to filter processes using simple text or regular expressions. It is useful to quickly filter processes further without having to create or modify user filters.

The search is performed on the properties selected in the Quick-search filter and within the context of current user filter and selected view type.


For example, if view type is set to `Hierarchy, expand children dimmed` or `Hierarchy, expand children fully` quicksearch will match also processes that are children of processes matching the search query (recursively).

### Text Search
By default, quicksearch performs a simple text search. The search is case sensitive or case insensitive depending on the settings and matches any process containing the given string in any of the selected properties.

### Regex Search
To use regex expressions, these need to be enclosed in forward slashes. The search is case sensitive or case insensitive depending on the settings.

#### Examples:

Match properties starting with "Fi":
```
/^Fi/
```

Match properties ending with "er":
```
/er$/
```

Match properties starting with "Mu" AND ending with "ic":
```
/^Mu.*ic$/
```

Match properties containing "java" OR "python":
```
/java|python/
```

Match properties containing years from 2020 to 2025 (useful for Version):
```
/202[0-5]/
```
Match properties NOT containing "arm64":
```
/^((?!arm64).)*$/
```

Match specific version numbers with three elements (useful for Version):
```
/\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?/
```

Match multiple version formats (x.x, x.x.x, x.x.x.x, x.x.x-x):
```
/v?(\d+\.\d+(?:\.\d+)*(?:[_\-][0-9a-zA-Z]+)?)/
```

Match home directory paths (useful for Command):
```
/\/Users\/[^\/]+\//
```

Match properties with dots:

```
/\./
```

Match anything NOT starting with "com.apple"
```
/^(?!com\.apple)/
```
